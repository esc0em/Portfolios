const e=`## Problem\r
\r
The client needed a product catalog inside Telegram as a Mini App: easy browsing, filters, and flow to cart or checkout without leaving the messenger.\r
\r
## Solution\r
\r
A web app (Telegram Web App) was built with React and TypeScript. Build tool: Vite. Data is loaded from an existing API; the UI adapts to mobile and Telegram theme (light/dark). Filters, product cards, and a basic cart were implemented.\r
\r
## Tech\r
\r
- **React** — UI and state\r
- **TypeScript** — typing\r
- **Vite** — build and dev server\r
\r
## Result\r
\r
Higher in-app conversion: users browse the catalog and place orders without leaving Telegram. Load and navigation stay fast thanks to SPA and caching.\r
\r
## Notes\r
\r
Telegram Web App SDK is used for init and theme; Telegram Payments can be added if required.\r
